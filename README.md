## Issues Encountered

1. I followed the pdf directions, and it gave me a *bunch* of files in the node modules folder. I'm not certain that I need them all, or why it populated so many... it just seemed like more than you discussed havign in class.

2. I had no issues completing the assignment; I was able to find any references in class material.

## Resources

All material was pulled from class.
